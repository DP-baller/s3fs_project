This C program demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt files using the RC4 cipher from the OpenSSL library. The program takes command-line arguments to specify the input file, output file, mode (encrypt or decrypt), and whether to use a salt with the key.

Execution Steps:

First, make sure you have the OpenSSL library installed on your system.

Compile the code using GCC with the following command:
gcc -o rc4_file_encryption rc4_file_encryption.c -lcrypto

This command compiles the code and creates an executable named "rc4_file_encryption".
======================================================================================================
Example Usage:

To encrypt a file, use the following command:
./rc4_file_encryption input_file.txt encrypted_file.bin -e -salt mypassword

To decrypt a file, use the following command:
./rc4_file_encryption encrypted_file.bin decrypted_file.txt -d -salt mypassword

In these examples, "input_file.txt" is the file to be encrypted, "encrypted_file.bin" is the output encrypted file, "decrypted_file.txt" is the output decrypted file, and "mypassword" is the encryption/decryption key. The "-e" flag indicates encryption mode, and the "-d" flag indicates decryption mode. The "-salt" flag indicates that a salt should be used in the key derivation process, while the "-nosalt" flag indicates that no salt should be used.
